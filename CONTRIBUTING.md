# Contributing to Bookingjini Icons

Our Vision is to offer an official open source SVG icon library called BookingJini Icons, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of the hospitality industry. This comprehensive collection of icons, curated by our talented creators at BookingJini, provides visually appealing and relevant imagery for your websites and applications.

Therefore we want to create a strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that our developers deserve.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ❤️
